# Talend-Customer-Data-Warehouse-Implementation.
This project is an implementation of Data Warehouse creation which is build by using Talend and Customer along with sales Data.

### Aims of this project:

Understand the workflow of Talend data warehousing.

### Data Sources

There are two data Sources from single type,
Customer Information
Transaction

### Data Import Methodology
Talend collects data from two different data sources which are in csv form.
For importing I have used single Metadata for db connection, and it connects two different sources initially.

### Steps

1. Joinning data tables into one.
2. Filter Data as per requirements.
3. Generate output.

All by following one execution click.

### Output 

Output was based on requirements, and export it to one csv file along with one MySQL database (Two types of databases).
However, it can be used to send to some other type of sdatabases for further investigation and Visualization.
The Main essence is that we don’t need to repeat the same work again and again rather we can simply run the whole framework and get the output irrespective of the unknown raw data generates everyday.
